# The Pirate Game
In The Pirate Game, you play as a pirate searching for a legendary chest on a mysterious, changing island.
You start by finding your landing spot, then move across the map to dig for gold and hidden items.
The game is a race against time and nature: the treasure actually moves if you take too long, 
and the ocean water slowly rises to drown the land.
To survive and win, you must manage your energy by eating coconuts, 
use a metal detector to track down the chest, and decide when to use powerful dynamite.
It’s a fun mix of exploration and strategy where you try to get the highest score before the island disappears!
